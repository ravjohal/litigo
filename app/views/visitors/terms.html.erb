Except for the non-exclusive license granted pursuant to this Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that all ownership, license, intellectual property and other rights and interests in and to the Service shall remain solely with Litigo.<br>
(8)Authorized Users who configure the Service to share or make available certain Content to the public, are deemed to acknowledge and agree that everyone will have access to the Content (“Public Content”). Litigo reserves the right, at any time, in its sole discretion, to take any action deemed necessary with respect to Public Content that violates these Terms of Service, including, but not limited to, removal of such Public Content.<br>
(9)Litigo reserves the right, at any time, if your bandwidth usage exceeds 5 gigabytes per month (5Gb/month), or significantly exceeds the average bandwidth usage of other Authorized Users (as determined solely by Litigo), to immediately disable your subscription or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.<br>
(10)Litigo reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any feature associated with the Service, with or without notice. Continued use of the Service following any modification constitutes your acceptance of the modification.<br>
