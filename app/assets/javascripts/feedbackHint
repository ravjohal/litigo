My guess is that you are using some SPA (Single Page Application) or some sort of Ajax navigation, and in that case you should call the fm.init upon "navigation complete event" 
Note that you might need to remove the ('.feedback_content') and ('.feedback_trigger') elements before calling the init (so your DOM won't get "spammed with them)
